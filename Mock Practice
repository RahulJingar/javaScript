✅ 1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is an interpreted language used to make more than interactive web pages by user interface. It is a tree-based structure, and 
it can be very slow if clicking any function, like a button, causes the whole page to refresh.

✅ 2. What is JavaScript Explain the diffrence between var, let and const.?
var: Declares a function-scoped variable that can be redeclared and reassigned.
let: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned but not redeclared.
const: Declares a block-scoped constant that cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

✅ 3. What are data types in JavaScript?
JavaScript has 8 data types:

Primitive Types:

String
Number
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Symbol (ES6)
BigInt (ES11)
Non-Primitive (Reference Type):

Object (includes Arrays, Functions, etc.)
✅ 4. What is hoisting in JavaScript?
Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope (function or global).


✅ 5. Explain the concept of “undefined” vs. “null”.
undefined: A variable declared but not assigned any value.
null: A variable that is clearly set to no value.

✅ 6. What are JavaScript functions, and how do you define them?
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.



✅ 7. What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?
An IIFE is a function that runs immediately after it is defined.


✅ 8. What is the purpose of the this keyword?
this refers to the object that is executing the current function.

In a method: this refers to the object.
Alone or in a regular function: this is the global object (window in browser).
In strict mode: this is undefined.
In arrow functions: this is lexically inherited (from parent scope).

✅ 9. What is scope in JavaScript?
Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.

Types:

Global Scope: Accessible everywhere
Local/Function Scope: Accessible inside functions
Block Scope (with let/const): Accessible inside {} blocks

✅ 10. Explain closures and how they work.
A closure is created when a function remembers its outer lexical environment, even after that outer function has finished executing.


✅ 11. What is an object in JavaScript?
An object is a collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings (or Symbols), and values can be any data type, including functions.


✅ 12. How do you create an object in JavaScript?
There are several ways:

✅ 13. What is the difference between Object.keys() and Object.values()?
Object.keys(obj) returns an array of the keys of the object.
Object.values(obj) returns an array of the values of the object.

✅ 14. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript?
Synchronous: Code is executed line by line, blocking the execution of the next line until the current line finishes.
Asynchronous: Code is non-blocking, and execution can continue while waiting for an operation to complete.

✅ 15. What are callbacks, and how do they work?
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be called after some operation is done.

✅ 16. Explain Promises and how they work and Promise.all.
Promise is a javaScript future result. if success goes to .then if fail goes to .catch and it is two parameter resolve and reject


States of a Promise:

Pending: initial state
Resolved (fulfilled): operation completed successfully
Rejected: operation failed
🔸 Promise.all()
Promise.all() takes an array of promises and returns a single Promise that:

Resolves when all promises succeed
Rejects if any one fails

✅ 17. What is async/await, and how is it used?
Async/await is a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. 
An async function always returns a Promise, and await pauses execution until that Promise is resolved or rejected. 
It makes asynchronous code cleaner and more readable, avoiding long .then() chains.

OR

async makes a function that promises to do something later.

await tells the code to wait for that promise to finish before continuing.

OR

You use async to create a function that can run in the background. Inside that function, you use await to pause the code on one line and wait for a task to finish before moving on to the next line.


✅ 18. What are arrays in JavaScript?
Array is a collection of data in JavaScript. It can store multiple values like numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays in a single variable.


✅ 19. How do you iterate over an array?
There are several ways to loop through an array:


✅ 20. What are some common array methods?
🔹 Mutating methods:
push() – adds to end
pop() – removes from end
shift() – removes from start
unshift() – adds to start
splice() – remove/replace/insert at index
🔹 Non-mutating methods:
slice(start, end) – returns shallow copy
map() – transforms each element
filter() – returns elements that meet condition
reduce() – reduces to single value
find() – returns first match
includes() – checks existence

✅ 21. All Array Method,String,Object Method?
✅ 21. How do you handle errors in JavaScript?
JavaScript provides two main ways to handle errors: try…catch and .then().catch(). try…catch is used for synchronous code and is simple to use. .then().catch() is used for Promises in asynchronous code and allows handling errors effectively in async operations.


✅ 22. What is the difference between try…catch and Promise error handling?
try...catch handles errors in synchronous code, while Promise .catch() is used to handle errors in asynchronous code.


✅ 23. What are template literals, and how do you use them?
Template literals use backticks (`) and allow:

Multiline strings
Embedded expressions using ${}

✅ 24. Explain destructuring assignment.
Destructuring is a way to unpack values from arrays or objects into variables.

Array destructuring:

Object destructuring:

✅ 25. What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?
Arrow functions are shorter syntax for writing functions and they do not have their own this.


✅ 26. What are spread and rest operators?
Both use the same syntax (...) but behave differently based on context.

🔹 Spread Operator:
Used to unpack elements of an array or object.


🔹 Rest Operator:
Used to collect remaining values into an array or object.


✅ 27. What are JavaScript modules, and why are they used?
JavaScript modules are files where you write code that can be reused in other files.


✅ 29. What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
the DOM is a tree-based structure. It allows JavaScript to access and change HTML elements. The page does not refresh automatically when you click a button; it only updates what is needed, which makes the webpage faster if used correctly.


✅ 30. What is the difference between == and ===?
== checks if the values are equal, but === checks both the value and the data type strictly.

✅ 31. Explain the concept of “event loop”.
The event loop is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking asynchronous operations, even though it is single-threaded.

How it works:
1. Executes code from the call stack

2. Handles asynchronous tasks via callback queue (like setTimeout, Promises, etc.)

3. The event loop checks if the call stack is empty, then pushes queued tasks to the stack.


✅ 32. What is debouncing?
Debouncing is a technique used to limit the number of times a function is executed.

✅ Example use case: A search bar should only make API calls after the user stops typing.


✅ 33. What are higher-order functions?
A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.


✅ 34. What is the difference between call(), apply(), and bind()?
🔹 call():

Invokes a function immediately, with a given this value and arguments passed individually.

🔹 apply():

Invokes a function immediately, with a given this value and arguments passed as an array.

🔹 bind():

Returns a new function with a given this value and optional arguments, but does not execute it immediately.


✅ 35. What is the difference between setTimeout and setInterval?
MethodDescription:-

setTimeoutRuns a function once after delaysetIntervalRuns a function repeatedly at intervals


✅ 36. What are symbols in JavaScript?
Symbol is a primitive data type introduced in ES6. It represents a unique identifier.


✅ 37. What are pure functions?
A pure function:

Always returns the same output for the same input
Has no side effects (does not modify external state)

✅ 38. What is currying, and why is it useful?
Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is converted into a sequence of functions that each take one argument.


✅ Currying is useful for:

Function reuse
Partial application
Code readability
✅ 39. What are JavaScript frameworks/libraries?
JavaScript frameworks/libraries are tools that help build apps faster and cleaner.

Libraries (help you with specific tasks):
jQuery
Lodash
Chart.js
Frameworks (provide structure and tools):
React (library, but often used like a framework)
Vue.js
Angular
Next.js (React-based framework)
Node.js (for backend)
✅ 40. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript.
OOP in JavaScript uses objects to model real-world entities. Key concepts:

Classes — Blueprints for creating objects
Objects — Instances of classes
Encapsulation — Bundling data with methods
Inheritance — Reuse properties/methods from another class
Polymorphism — Same method behaves differently in different objects

✅ 41. What is a regular expression?
A regular expression (RegEx) is a pattern used to match character combinations in strings.


✅ 42. What is the difference between strict mode and non-strict mode in JavaScript?
🔹 Strict Mode
Strict mode is a way to run JavaScript with more rules. It makes your code safer by stopping mistakes that JavaScript normally allows.


🔹 Non-Strict Mode (Default Mode)
Non-strict mode is the default way JavaScript runs. It is more flexible but also more risky, because it does not stop many mistakes.


✅ 43. What is a constructor function?
A constructor function is used to create multiple objects with the same structure.


✅ 44. How do you implement inheritance in JavaScript?
There are two ways:

a) Using Prototypes:

b) Using Classes (ES6):


✅ 45. Explain the concept of polymorphism in JavaScript.
Polymorphism means many forms — the same method behaves differently based on the object calling it.

✅ 46. What is the difference between prototype-based inheritance and class-based inheritance?
🔹 Prototype-based inheritance:

A style where objects inherit directly from other objects using the prototype chain.

🔹 Class-based inheritance:

A style where classes define blueprints, and objects are created using the class and extends keywords (introduced in ES6).
